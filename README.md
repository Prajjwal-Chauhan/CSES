# CSES Problem Set Solutions 📚

Welcome to the repository dedicated to solving the challenges presented in the CSES Problem Set using multiple programming languages: Java, Python, and C++. This repository is not only a personal reference but also an open community resource encouraging contributions in different languages or via alternative solutions.

## About the CSES Problem Set 🧠

The CSES Problem Set offers a collection of competitive programming practice problems, designed to provide a platform for mastering algorithms and data structures across various topics essential in competitive programming.

Within each category, solutions are stored in files named after the problems they solve.

## Languages Used 🚀

- **Java**: Known for its object-oriented capabilities and robustness.
- **Python**: Valued for its readability and quick prototyping.
- **C++**: Preferred for its speed and control over system resources.

## Contributing 🤝

Contributions are warmly welcomed! Whether you want to add solutions in a new language or provide alternative solutions in an existing language, follow these guidelines:

### *Adding a New Language*
1. **Create a Branch**: Name your branch in the format `{your-username}/{language}`.
2. **Add Your Solution**: Make sure to create a new directory for the language if it doesn't exist, and follow the existing structure.
3. **Commit Your Changes**: Include a clear message describing the solution and the language added.
4. **Open a Pull Request**: Detail the additions in your pull request and link it to relevant issues (if applicable).

### *Providing a New Approach*
1. **Create a Branch**: Name your branch as `{your-username}/{language}`.
2. **Modify an Existing File**: Add your solution as a new function in the existing problem file. Include comments detailing the approach and its runtime.
3. **Document Your Changes**: In your pull request, describe how your solution differs and mention the runtime of your solution.
4. **Open a Pull Request**: Ensure that your code is well-documented and explain your changes thoroughly.

### *General Guidelines*
- Ensure your code is clean, well-commented, and adheres to the overall style of the project.
- Include comments in your code explaining your logic and the complexity of your approach.
- Update or add any relevant documentation or comments in existing solutions to improve clarity.
- Make sure to maintain the repository structure and avoid commiting unnecessary files (only commit the solution files).
